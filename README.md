# ScamAway API
The Anti-Phishing Discord Bot API

[Documentation](https://scamaway.xenorio.xyz)

## Archival Notice

As Discord has now finally taken the decision of disabling my main account for no reason whatsoever, I have decided to step away from it completely.
This includes not developing any software for it anymore.

You can still use ScamAway if you host both the bot and the API yourself, it will just not get any further updates whatsoever, not even security related

Feel free to fork the project and keep developing it!


## What's this?
This is the backend for the [ScamAway](https://github.com/Xenorio/ScamAway/) Discord bot

It is not recommended to host this yourself, unless you want to handle reported domains

## Setup
- Install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org)
- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies with ``npm install``
- Configure ``config.default.js``
- Start the server with ``npm start``
